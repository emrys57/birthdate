Birthdate Calculator website

The code here is the source of the [birthdate calculator](http://www.eversholt.org.uk/birthdate/). It calculates an earliest and latest possible birthdate, given a range of possible ages on a range of possible dates.

The code is not at all clean, but it does try to be precise about the computation. Some details are described in the [accompanying blog](http://www.eversholt.org.uk/blog/?cat=3).

I hesitate to suggest that anyone copies this code, because it's not well-organised. However, should you wish, I release it under an [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
